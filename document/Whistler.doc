WhistlerLang v1.2 — Syntexly That Beautiful 🐧🦆




WhistlerLang is a custom programming language designed for learning, prototyping, and creating simple yet powerful scripts. This document explains the language, its philosophy, and the basic commands and structures for new users.
Why Use WhistlerLang?



WhistlerLang provides a stable, predictable, and educational environment for programmers and students. Reasons to use this stable version include:
Stability: Core parser, evaluator, and runtime are tested and organised.
Predictability: Strong typing rules (except the 'say' sugar) reduce runtime surprises.
Education-first design: Syntax and examples are tailored for classrooms and beginners.
Interactivity: REPL interface allows rapid experimentation, like Lisp-style interactive sessions.
Portability: Single-file build and object exporter make it easy to experiment across platforms.
Getting Started
To start using WhistlerLang:
Open a terminal.
Navigate to the WhistlerLang folder.
Run the language executable or build scripts as needed.
Use the REPL for interactive testing and script execution.
REPL Commands
quit / exit : Exit WhistlerLang.
run <file.whlst> : Run a WhistlerLang script file.
say "text" : Print a string to the REPL.
time.print : Display current time.
time.set "" "" : Change time display format (e.g., "{date} {hou}:{min}:{sec}").
help : Show detailed instructions and guidance.
Basic Syntax
Variables:
let  =  : Declare a variable with strong typing.
Example: let user = "Alice"
Printing:
say "Hello World" : Print a string to the REPL.
You can concatenate using +: say "Welcome " + user + " to WhistlerLang"
Conditionals:
if   elif   else  end
Example: let score = 85 if score >= 90 say "Grade: A" elif score >= 80 say "Grade: B" else say "Grade: C or below" end
Time Commands:
time.print : Shows current system time.
time.set "" "" : Customise the display of time.
Examples
say "Hello World from WhistlerLang!" let user = "Alice" say "Welcome " + user + " to Syntexly That Beautiful" time.print time.set "{date} {hou}:{min}:{sec}" "ms" time.print let score = 85 if score >= 90 say "Grade: A" elif score >= 80 say "Grade: B" else say "Grade: C or below" end
